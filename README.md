# Screentaku

</div>

Screentaku is a simple and easy-to-use tool to take screencaps of a video file (e.g. an anime or a movie) at set intervals and then go through them and select the best ones.

## Where does the name come from?

Screentaku is a wordplay combining the japanese word **選択** (せんたく; sentaku) with the word "screen". Sentaku means "choice" or "selection" in japanese.
